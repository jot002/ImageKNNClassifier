# ImageKNNClassifier

This class attempts to make prediction through the pattern of previous
    data. This classifier is trained by using training data within the model
    to predict the most popular labels in a collection of nearest training
    data. One way to do this process if through the use of the Euclidean
    distance, which is described in the method "distance()".
